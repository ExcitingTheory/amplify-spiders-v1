## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Email [info@excitingtheory.com](mailto:info@excitingtheory.com) with any security concerns.

We will prioritize security issues and do our best to address them quickly. If you have found an issue that you believe to be a security issue, please do NOT open an issue on GitHub. Instead, please email us at [info@excitingtheory.com](mailto:info@excitingtheory.com).
If you have a patch for a security issue, please submit a pull request only once we have confirmed the issue so that we can verify the fix and release a patch for it in a coordinated and timely manner.
